Baux (pronounced Box) is a simple browser based notes application. It runs
completely in the browser - no server side application processing - and stores 
notes in a remote CouchDB instance (currently hosted on iriscouch.com).

Notes are to be titled with any unique and memorizable sentence. This key is
used to generate a unique ID in the database as well as to encrypt the contents
of the note.

Security and privacy are ensured as follows:-
- The key only exists in the browser and is never transmitted
- It is hashed using SHA1 to generate a unique ID for the database
- It is used as the key with which the note contents are AES encypted

On the database side, there is no way to access any user data since the key is
not recoverable from the hash, nor are the contents recoverable without the key.

Baux is currently hosted on GitHub pages but can be run completely in the 
browser as a bookmarklet. There is no dependency on GitHub beyond the initial
bookmarklet creation. Permalinks to notes are offered on GitHub and are shareable
for convenience but is not required. Sharing the key is sufficient to access any
note.

The bookmarklet runs on most web pages as an overlay and can be used to store
notes that are context sensitive to that page. The last key is saved as a cookie
for convenience. This will be changed to localstorage to avoid transmitting the
key to the server (currently GitHub whose logs are inaccessible to us anyway).
